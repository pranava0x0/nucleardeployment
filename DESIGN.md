# DESIGN.md: Universal Visual & UX Principles

> Base file for every project in this folder with a UI. Project-specific `design.md` files extend this with palette, motif, and content rules. When project conflicts with base, project wins.

## Deployment Core visual identity

**Identity:** a reactor construction log meets an editorial public record: graphite and ceramic surfaces, acid-yellow energy signal, Charter-like display serif against a compact system sans/mono stack, with a radial deployment core as the memorable move. Section labels read like plain field notes—not tiny, tracked, all-caps "eyebrows." Dense rules and evidence rows take priority over ornamental whitespace.

- The acid-yellow accent means verified forward motion or the primary action. Signal orange marks a current gate or unresolved transition. Neither color is decorative.
- Use fine grid lines, radial geometry, ledgers, and stage tracks. Avoid cooling-tower imagery, flags, seals, retro atoms, green-energy branding, and neon cyberpunk.
- Project status must remain legible without color: stage number, label, evidence text, and next gate always travel together.
- Pipeline summaries stay compact: every stage shows its number, name, plain-language meaning, and a count with its unit. Never use a naked number or empty vertical bar as the explanation.
- Map markers encode stage number and link to a plain list that exposes the same records.
- The landing page leads with the national status and real sample counts. No generic marketing hero or feature-card row.
- System fonts only. Serif for the national narrative and large numbers; sans for explanation; mono for labels, dates, stages, and source-state language.
- Corners stay square. Structure comes from rules, grids, and contrast rather than shadows or glass effects.
- Mobile preserves essential content, uses horizontal scrolling only for stage sequences or metric strips, and keeps touch controls at least 44px high.

## 1. Posture

Three principles set every call below:

1. **Refuse the default look (top priority).** Shipping the generic AI aesthetic (violet-to-indigo gradient, centered hero with a gradient headline and two buttons, the same sans everywhere, emoji feature cards on slate-gray) reads instantly as "a model made this" and makes the product interchangeable with a thousand others. A real product looks *decided*: each one earns a specific, defensible identity anchored in its subject. See §1.1; this overrides convenience every time.
2. **The content is the product. Chrome earns its pixels.** Anything that isn't the primary surface (map, feed, list, form, canvas) justifies itself by helping the user understand or narrow it. Backgrounds, textures, and decoration sit low (≤~10% opacity/contrast) so anything assertive is real data. Every color encodes meaning; decorative color competes with the data for attention.
3. **Performance is a design constraint, not a follow-up.** Every "nice touch" (web font, blur, full-page animation) competes with first paint and the 60fps budget. Choose perf when they conflict.

Aesthetic follows the product: an editorial dashboard reads like the FT; a consumer app like its category; a government tool like a public record. Don't paste one voice onto another. Project `design.md` carries the *specific* identity; this file carries the *universal* rules it must respect.

### 1.1 The default-AI tells, and what to do instead

The giveaways of an unconsidered, model-generated UI. Each right-hand cell is the *minimum* move away. This isn't optional polish. It's what separates a product from a demo.

| Default-AI tell | Do instead |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| Violet→indigo (or teal→blue) gradient backdrop; gradient-filled headline text | Commit to a flat palette **derived from the subject** (a water tracker → deep-water blues; a crash atlas → newsprint black/white with one alarm red; a finance tool → ledger greens on cream). One accent, used sparingly. Gradients only when they encode data (a scale, a ramp). |
| The same neutral sans (Inter / Geist / Roboto) on everything | Pick a pairing **with a point of view**: a real display face (serif, slab, or a distinctive grotesque) against a quiet workhorse. System stacks are still the default for perf (§2), but *choose* the stack deliberately; don't accept the first one. |
| Centered hero: big headline + subtitle + two buttons, nothing below the fold but feature cards | **Lead with the tool or the content.** The first screen should *do* something: show the map, the table, the feed, real numbers. Asymmetric and editorial layouts beat the symmetric marketing-page template. |
| Three-up grid of cards, each with an emoji icon and a sentence | Break the grid. Use scale, density, and rule lines to build hierarchy. Real iconography or none. Emoji is not an icon system (§11). |
| Glassmorphism, `backdrop-blur`, and a soft drop shadow on every surface | Choose **one** structural device (hairline rule lines, a hard border, a visible grid) and commit to it. Flat surfaces read as more serious and cost less per frame (§10). |
| Everything rounded to the same `1rem`/`2xl` radius | Vary radius with meaning (§5). Sharper corners read as editorial/authoritative; soft corners as friendly/consumer. Pick per project, don't default. |
| Dark mode = slate `#0f172a` with indigo accents | Derive the dark surface from the project's own palette, not the framework default. |
| "✨ New", "Beta" pill ceremony; vague benefit-copy ("Powerful insights at your fingertips") | Concrete labels, real counts, source trails. Say what the thing *is*, with a number. |

**Get creative on purpose:** before writing CSS, name the identity in one line in the project `design.md`: a reference point (a publication, era, or object), a subject-anchored palette, a type pairing, and **one memorable move** that's yours (a masthead rule, textured paper ground, monospace data spine, hand-tuned chart style). One deliberate move escapes the default; the rest of this document keeps it disciplined.

---

## 2. Typography: system stacks only by default

No web fonts unless justified: a Google Fonts link costs a render-blocking RTT and ~50KB, and the system stack approximates Charter / Inter / SF Mono everywhere.

```css
--font-sans:  -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", system-ui,
              "Helvetica Neue", Arial, sans-serif;
--font-serif: "Charter", "Source Serif 4", "Source Serif Pro",
              "Iowan Old Style", "Apple Garamond", "Palatino", "Georgia",
              "Times New Roman", serif;
--font-mono:  ui-monospace, "SF Mono", "JetBrains Mono", Menlo,
              Consolas, monospace;
```

- **Serif for editorial display** (H1, hero H2, KPI numerals, verbatim quotes). Signals "this is content, not chrome."
- **Sans for body and UI** (everything else).
- **Mono for code, IDs, paths, share codes.** Anything that has to round-trip a copy/paste.
- **Tabular numerals.** `font-feature-settings: "tnum"` on `:root`. Any column of numbers (KPIs, table cells, dates, counts) lines up.

If the project genuinely needs a custom font (rare, most don't), audit the alternative system stack on target browsers before introducing a fetch.

---

## 3. Color tokens

**All colors live as CSS custom properties on `:root`, with `[data-theme="dark"]` overrides.** JS reads via `getComputedStyle()`. Never hardcode a hex outside `:root`.

```css
:root {
  --bg: …;          /* page background */
  --surface: …;     /* cards, panels */
  --surface-2: …;   /* inputs, secondary surfaces */
  --border: …;
  --text: …;
  --text-muted: …;
  --accent: …;      /* primary CTA, focus ring */
}

[data-theme="dark"] {
  --bg: …;
  /* ... */
}
```

**Every filled surface needs an explicit `--on-<role>` foreground token, per theme.** "White text on the accent" is not a theme-independent fact: a dark theme's accent is usually a *light* tint of the same hue, so the identical rule that measures 5.4:1 in light mode measures **2.7:1** in dark. Ship `--on-accent` / `--on-status` (white on light, near-black on dark) rather than a literal `#fff` beside `background: var(--accent)`. This is the main reason the "no hardcoded hex outside `:root`" rule exists — a literal hex is precisely the thing that can't flip with the theme.

**Automate the contrast check; a colour annotated "AA" in a doc is a claim, not a measurement.** A ~60-line test that parses the token block, computes WCAG ratios for every text/bg pair the UI actually renders, and asserts ≥4.5:1 in **both** themes will find things review never does. On its first run against a hand-written palette it caught three at once: the white-on-accent case above (2.73:1, already live); a reference amber annotated "AA on paper" that actually measured 4.48:1; and an accent-on-accent-weak pair at 4.40:1 that forced the selected tab's *label* onto the darker `--accent-hover` (the icon beside it may keep the lighter accent — non-text is WCAG 1.4.11, 3:1). Fold in the "no hardcoded hex outside the token blocks" assertion while you're there; it's the same parse.

### 3.1 Semantic separation

When a project uses color to encode meaning (status, stance, category), keep *meaning* and *brand* in separate token families:

- **Brand / surface tokens**: neutral chrome (`--bg`, `--surface`, `--text`).
- **Semantic tokens**: meaning (`--status-{success,warning,error}`, `--stance-{positive,mixed,negative}`).
- **Category tokens**: distinguish without ranking (`--category-{a,b,c}`).

Never conflate them. Coloring "category" with the same palette as "status" tells the user "category A is bad," which is rarely what you mean.

### 3.2 Brand-adjacent colors are not brand colors

When showing third-party brands (companies, products, services), use **brand-adjacent but neutral** tones: desaturated versions that distinguish without implying endorsement. Using a company's actual brand color implies affiliation and invites legal questions.

### 3.3 Theme swap is JS, not filter

Toggle light/dark via the CSS variable swap plus a JS pass over any canvas/SVG layers reading the variables. Never `filter: brightness/contrast` a tile pane or content layer. It recomposites every frame and tanks mobile perf.

---

## 4. Spacing scale

A 4 / 8 px ladder covers ~99% of cases:

`4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 22, 24, 28, 32`

Round `7px`/`13px` to the nearest step unless you have a reason. Skip an explicit `--space-2` variable until a refactor would save more LOC than it churns.

---

## 5. Radii, shadows, motion

- **Radii:** `4` (chips), `6` (small inputs), `8` (buttons, cards), `12` (modals), `14` (mobile bottom sheets), `999` (pills).
- **Shadows:** one soft (`0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)`) for at-rest cards; one elevated (`0 4px 18px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)`) for panels and toasts. Dark theme uses heavier alpha (`0.4–0.5`) because contrast against a dark `--bg` needs more.
- **Motion:**
  - `90ms`: table row hover, color swaps
  - `120ms`: button / input hover
  - `200ms`: panel slide-in/out, modal open
  - `300ms max`: toast, fade
  - **No motion above 300ms.** No CSS animations on hot paths (pan / zoom / scroll).
- **Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.** When set, kill panel transforms and any non-essential transition.

---

## 6. Layout: mobile-first, three breakpoints

Default to three viewport bands, matched 1:1 with Tailwind defaults:

| Width band     | Name    | Tailwind prefix | Layout shape                                     |
| -------------- | ------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `< 640px`      | Mobile  | (none)          | Single column, sticky toolbar, FAB, bottom sheets |
| `640–1023px`   | Tablet  | `sm:`, `md:`    | 2-up grids, full CTA labels, hamburger nav        |
| `≥ 1024px`     | Desktop | `lg:`           | 3-up / 4-up grids, inline nav, side panels        |

A fourth tier is rarely justified. Desktop scales fine above 1280 if you cap content width (`max-width: 1280px; margin: 0 auto`).

**Don't use container queries unless an independent embedded component needs them.** Viewport media queries are simpler, work everywhere, and match how the rest of the layout reasons.

**Don't duplicate DOM trees for mobile / desktop.** A `<section class="hero-copy">` that's `display: none` on mobile is fine; rendering a separate mobile-only block is not.

---

## 7. Mobile patterns

- **Bottom sheets, not full-page overlays**, for detail panels and filters. A full overlay covers the primary surface and breaks the "tap a result → read → keep browsing" loop.
- **Carousels (scroll-snap), not stacked grids**, for KPI strips. Stacking pushes the primary surface below the fold.
- **Hide hero copy on mobile**, keep KPI / summary chips. The user already knows what they opened.
- **Bump input font-size to 16px on iOS** to suppress auto-zoom on focus.
- **Title attributes don't work on touch; use hover explainer cards instead.** The `title` attribute is a browser affordance on desktop (tooltip on hover) but invisible on touch. For any term that needs a definition or acronym that needs expansion, use a dedicated popover/card that appears on hover or focus, with keyboard access (Escape to close) and optional touch flow (card + link to glossary). Why: accessibility (title attributes don't reach screen readers well) + mobile coverage. How to apply: create a `.term-card` component with the term, definition, and category; auto-tag the first bare occurrence per block from a glossary.
- **Respect safe-area-inset.** Bottom-edge FABs, sheets, and bars use `bottom: max(1rem, env(safe-area-inset-bottom))` so they don't sit under the home indicator.
- **Sticky toolbars** so users can switch views from any scroll position; keep them slim (~52px).
- **Touch targets ≥ 44 × 44px.** Non-negotiable. Even for "small" admin actions. For a compact visual control (a theme swatch, a small toggle) that shouldn't grow visually, expand the *hit area* with an invisible `::before`/`::after` overlay sized to 44×44 rather than resizing the element itself.
- **The `<details>` primitive is preferred over JS accordions.** Native, keyboard-accessible, screen-reader-friendly; `open` toggle doesn't re-render the inner content.

## 8. Components

### 8.1 Buttons

| Variant   | Use                                  | Spec                                                 |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Primary   | The one CTA per view                 | Filled `--accent`, white text, rounded 8/12          |
| Secondary | Adjacent actions                     | Bordered, transparent bg, accent text                |
| Ghost     | Tertiary / inline                    | No border, no bg, accent text, hover bg `--surface-2` |
| Icon      | Toolbar (filters, theme, share)      | 32×32 (44×44 touch target), rounded 8, hover bg     |

Focus state is a 2px `--accent` outline with 2px offset via `:focus-visible` (not `:focus`) so mouse users don't see it on click.

### 8.2 Pills

A single base `.pill { padding: 1px 8px; border-radius: 999px; font-size: 10.5px; font-weight: 600 }` with semantic variants. Outline pills (`.pill.outline`) for "candidate" / "eligible" / "ready" signals; solid pills for status. Stack left-to-right as a readability ladder (program → status → readiness).

### 8.3 Cards

`background: var(--surface); border: 1px solid var(--border); border-radius: 12; padding: 16` is the safe default. Use shadow `0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.05)` at rest, `0 4px 12px rgba(accent, 0.15)` on hover.

### 8.4 KV grids (detail panels)

```html
<dl class="kv">
  <dt>Label</dt>
  <dd>Value <span class="dd-note">optional sub-line</span></dd>
</dl>
```

`grid-template-columns: 130px 1fr` on desktop, `110px 1fr` on mobile. Null values render as italic muted (`<dd class="muted-cell">Not available</dd>`), never blank.

### 8.5 Toasts

One at a time. Don't grow into a queue. If you need stacked toasts, swap in a real library. Lazy-mount a single `#toast` div, fade in via `.visible`, auto-fade after 4s.

### 8.6 Comparison matrix

A matrix answers a binary question: "does this entity touch this dimension at all?" Render a single `✓` per populated cell, not a count. Volume belongs in the subsidiary list, not the at-a-glance grid; digits make the matrix harder to scan and over-state precision.

### 8.7 Sub-tabs (a panel that's grown too long)

When one tab's content runs past ~2–3 screens, split it into **sub-tabs** instead of a longer scroll: a second, lighter tablist *inside* the panel (underline style, not the boxed primary tabs), each sub-panel `role="tabpanel"`. Keep the same ARIA contract as the primary tabs (`role="tab"` / `aria-selected` / roving `tabindex` / arrow-key navigation) and a ≥44px touch target on `pointer:coarse`. Example: a long comment list split into Overview / Respondent types / Comment summaries — each one screen instead of one ten-screen scroll.

### 8.8 Metadata chips (multi-lens tags)

When a row carries several orthogonal tag sets (e.g. three classification lenses), render each lens as a small tint chip in its own color, lenses separated by a hairline. Abbreviate the chip label and carry the full meaning in `title` plus an `sr-only` group label so the grouping survives for screen readers. Keep it to ~3 lenses or the row stops scanning; push the rest to the deep-dive. Color is a *cue*, never the only signal — the text is the label.

### 8.9 Stat row — one number per real thing

A stat strip must have exactly as many cells as it has real numbers; if a metric is dropped, drop the grid column too (a `repeat(N)` that outruns the items leaves a dead cell). Never keep a stat whose label has gone stale — "9 read in full" becomes misleading once all are read. The honest number is the one a careful editor would write on deadline.

### 8.10 Model-output numbers show a fixed decimal precision

A projection or model output should always render with a fixed number of decimals (e.g. always 1), even when the value would round to a whole number. A whole-number-looking projection reads as a measured fact; one decimal signals "this is an estimate."

### 8.11 Map interactions: calm selection, and a non-map path to the same data

Selecting a result on a map should highlight and pan to it, never re-zoom, unless the item is off-screen — repeated re-zooming on every click reads as janky. Provide an explicit "fit all" reset instead of relying on zoom-out. For a large ranked dataset shown on a map, also expose it as a plain sortable table — it gives mobile users, and anyone doing a close read, a non-map path to the same ranked data.

### 8.12 Persisted UI state should default to session-only

A "last active tab" or similar convenience state should reset on a fresh page load unless there's a specific reason it shouldn't survive a visit. Use in-memory module state, not `localStorage`, for this class of affordance — persisting it to storage means a returning user lands on an arbitrary pane instead of the intended default view.

### 8.13 Sparklines & meters

A trend line at a glance is a hand-rolled inline `<svg>` `polyline`, not a charting library: a sparkline is ~20 lines of coordinate math, and a dependency for it is dead weight (§ 10, and CLAUDE.md "boring tech"). Scale the series to the box with min-max, but handle the zero-range case explicitly: when every point is equal, `span = max - min || 1` doesn't center the result, it maps every value to `1 - 0 = 1`, the far edge (a flat sparkline pinned to the bottom, not the middle). Special-case `max === min` to place the flat line at the mid-line, not wherever the degenerate division falls out. It's a lossy visual, so it carries the exact latest value in `aria-label` ("Hype over 24 observations, latest 158,000"); a screen reader and a test both need the number the glyph stands for. Fewer than 2 points: render nothing (a one-point line is noise).

A proportion bar (e.g. a within-group normalized score) is `role="meter"` with `aria-valuemin/max/now`, not a bare `<div>`. Fill width is the only thing that changes; keep the track visible so 0% still reads as "measured, low," not "missing." Never let the bar imply a comparison the data doesn't support: a bar is only honest within one comparable group (§ 12.28 below).

Build bar/column charts as **pure DOM + CSS**, not a library or a canvas: a stacked timeline is flex columns of `<div>` segments with `height`/`width` in px or %, and semantic color from `var(--status-x)` set inline. The payoff is theming — DOM/inline-SVG that references CSS vars **re-themes on the dark swap for free**, with no JS at all. The `getComputedStyle`-and-repaint pass from § 3.3 is only for *canvas/WebGL* layers that can't read a var; don't reach for it when the chart is DOM. Tabular-nums on every value, and a `title`/`aria-label` on each segment since color alone isn't a label.

## 9. Accessibility (baseline)

| Concern                | Implementation                                                                |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Skip to content        | `<a class="skip-link">` is the first focusable element; visually hidden until focused |
| Landmarks              | `<header role="banner">` · `<nav>` · `<main role="main">` · `<aside>` · `<footer role="contentinfo">` |
| Focus indicators       | `:focus-visible { outline: 2px solid var(--accent); outline-offset: 2px }` on every interactive element |
| Clickable non-buttons  | A table row / card / `div` used as a control gets `role="button"` + `tabindex="0"` + an Enter/Space key handler + a focus-visible ring. A bare `onclick` is mouse-only: invisible to keyboard and screen readers |
| Live region for counts | `<span aria-live="polite">` so result counts and dynamic state changes announce |
| Filters as fieldsets   | `<fieldset><legend>` for grouped controls                                     |
| Tabs                   | `role="tablist"` / `role="tab"` / `role="tabpanel"` / `aria-controls` / `aria-selected` |
| Color contrast         | All text/bg pairs ≥ 4.5:1 in both light and dark themes (verify with audit tools) |
| Reduced motion         | `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` kills non-essential transforms      |
| Touch                  | `touch-action: manipulation` on interactive elements                          |

## 10. Performance constraints on design

Design decisions that look like aesthetic calls but are actually performance calls:

| Choice                                      | Reason                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| System fonts only (default)                 | Save a render-blocking RTT + ~50KB                          |
| No `backdrop-filter: blur` on map / overlay | Recomposites on every pan/zoom frame                        |
| No `filter:` on hot panes                   | Same                                                        |
| CSS-var theme + JS re-paint                 | Theme swap doesn't trigger a full re-style cascade          |
| Canvas markers, not SVG                     | SVG nodes melt mobile at 10k+                               |
| Pagination + IntersectionObserver           | DOM stays small; sentinel auto-appends only when needed     |
| Lazy-load non-default data layers           | First paint stays small                                     |
| Lazy-load a blocking third-party `<script>` (cdnjs html2pdf, etc.) from the handler that needs it, not `<head>` | A render-blocking `<script>` in `<head>` delays first paint *and* stalls every Playwright `page.goto`: one e2e suite went from ~11 min with 5–13 flaky load timeouts to ~52s / 0 failures once it was deferred. Keep SRI on the lazy import |
| `<link rel="preload">` for critical JSON    | Races the JSON behind defer-loaded JS                       |
| `priority: "low"` on enrichment fetches     | Browser deprioritizes behind first-paint resources          |
| `contain: layout paint` on heavy panels     | Bounds invalidation cost when content re-renders            |
| Pre-render to static HTML, not a client runtime | A client-side WASM runtime cold-starts in tens of seconds; the same site pre-rendered to static HTML paints near-instantly |

If a proposal trades any of these for visual polish, it either (a) proves it works on a mid-range Android over throttled connection, or (b) gets explicit sign-off that the perf cost is acceptable.

## 11. Editorial / content rules

These apply to any project that surfaces data, claims, or content from external sources.

- **Cite primary sources.** Every numeric claim links to a primary/authoritative source, or it doesn't ship.
- **Source lines are bylines, not hidden metadata.** Every chart, KPI, and table carries its agency + capture date + link, compact but visible, a footnote, not a tooltip the reader has to hunt for.
- **A citation chip names the destination it links to, not a loose association.** If a source chip links to POWER Magazine, label it "POWER Magazine", not the author's primary affiliation ("Duke"). The link target and the visible credit must agree, or the chip misattributes. Keep the person + affiliation on the card; keep the publisher on the chip that opens it.
- **Separate fact from estimate from judgment.** Render observed facts, modeled estimates, and policy/editorial judgments as visibly distinct tiers; never let a confident-sounding estimate read as a measured fact. A composite score (safety index, risk rank) always shows its components, no black-box number.
- **Mechanism-first policy language.** "Shorten the crossing distance," not "make it safer." Name the lever, not the vibe.
- **Frame vocabulary forward, not deficit.** Load-bearing product terms set the user's mental model. *Top need* and *upgrade opportunity* point forward where *weakness* points back. Choose the framing in the project `design.md`, mirror it in field names and labels, and enforce it with a test that greps the build for banned words.
- **Surface "why".** Boolean badges ("Eligible", "Verified") carry their qualifying criteria inline (italic sub-line or tooltip). The badge alone is opaque.
- **One surface, two audiences: lead lay, demote expert, keep the load-bearing number in the open.** When a page serves both a layperson and a specialist (patient + clinician, citizen + analyst), open with the plain-language answer and tuck the expert detail behind `<details>`, but never bury the one fact both audiences need (the drug strength, the dollar figure, the deadline). Progressive disclosure hides depth, not the answer.
- **Title-case CAPS source data at ingest.** Government/scraped feeds ship ALL CAPS or sentinels (`-- Not Defined --`, `_NULL_`). Run `prettyName()` at ingest, preserve raw on `*_raw`, and keep an acronym whitelist (NASA, NPS, USA, …).
- **"Not available", not blank.** Optional fields render as italic muted placeholders.
- **"Adjacent", not "0.0 mi".** Render `n < threshold` as a meaningful word, not a misleading number.
- **No emojis by default.** Outline pills do the badge work. If the project's voice needs emoji (consumer/social), use sparingly and document in `design.md`.
- **Lowercase prose, uppercase labels.** Eyebrows, KPI labels, table heads, outline-pill text are uppercase with `0.04–0.14em` tracking; everything else sentence case.
- **AI-generated content is visibly distinguished**: a 3px accent left-border plus a model-credit meta line. The reader should never confuse primary data with generated narrative.
- **Borrow design *values*, never imitate a brand.** Take the useful values from a reference publication (high-contrast type, disciplined grids, rule lines, source trails, calm authority), not its masthead, logo, proprietary fonts, or furniture that implies you *are* them. The first screen is the tool, not a marketing page.

### 11.1 Voice: write like a person, not a model

Every word that ships (headings, labels, microcopy, empty states, tooltips, generated narrative, user-facing READMEs) gets a plain, specific voice. The model register is as recognizable in copy as the violet gradient is in layout (§ 1.1). This is the prose half of "refuse the default look."

**Tells to cut:**

| Tell | Example |
| ---- | ------- |
| LLM register words | *delve, leverage, robust, seamless, elevate, unlock, empower, harness, tapestry, testament, underscore, pivotal, crucial, comprehensive, cutting-edge, game-changer, ever-evolving, realm, navigate the complexities of* |
| Filler & throat-clearing | "it's worth noting that", "it's important to note", "in today's fast-paced world", "when it comes to", "at the end of the day" |
| Marketing vapor | "powerful insights at your fingertips", "take your X to the next level", "the ultimate solution for", "designed to help you" |
| Mechanical rhythm | rule-of-three everywhere ("fast, simple, and powerful"); "not only… but also"; the "X, not Y" antithesis as a headline mannerism ("Tailored, not uniform"; "a feature, not a hedge"), rewrite to a plain declarative; every sentence the same length |
| Hollow summaries | "In conclusion", "Overall", a closing line that restates the opening |
| Hedging when you know the answer | "generally", "typically", "in most cases" used to soften a fact you're sure of |
| Ceremony | emoji in body copy (per § 11), em-dash padding, exclamation marks selling a feature |
| Caption-register phrasing | "[Person] underscores that…", "[Report] highlights the importance of…", "[Source] makes clear that…" — the caption voice narrates instead of quoting. Use a verbatim short quote or a plain attribution ("X said…", "X found…") |
| Style/boilerplate in LLM-generated text | AI-register words, em-dashes, and caption phrases in generated summaries or descriptions. Run a grep linter over the built output — it catches these for free, before any human audit |

**Do instead:**

- **Lead with the specific.** A number, a name, a date beats an adjective: "Tracks 49 cases since 2014," not "comprehensive tracking of enforcement actions."
- **Short declaratives.** Say the thing and stop. Vary sentence length because a person would, not for rhythm.
- **Concrete verbs, plain nouns.** "Download the report," not "seamlessly access your documents."
- **Cut the warm-up.** If the first sentence only clears its throat, delete it and open on the point.
- **Read it aloud.** If you wouldn't say it to a colleague, rewrite it.
- **No em-dashes in displayed prose** (house style across these projects). The em-dash reads as a model tic at scale; replace it with a comma, colon, period, or parentheses as the sentence needs. Verbatim quotes, reporter cites, and source titles are exempt. Range dashes become "to" when the identifiers already contain hyphens ("EL26-67-000 to EL26-72-000", a dash there is ambiguous). Enforce with a grep test over the rendered build.

The test mirrors the code rule ([CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) → "AI has no taste"): *would a careful human writer have written this line?* If it reads like it was generated to fill space, cut it or rewrite it.

### 11.2 SEO & social metadata

For any public page, get the share card and the dates right. They're how Google, LLMs, and social scrapers read the page:

- **Social-card OG images: ship JPG, not WebP.** LinkedIn (and some other scrapers) won't render WebP link previews. Use a JPG hero for `og:image` / `twitter:image` (`summary_large_image`); fall back to a default image for pages without a hero.
- **`datePublished` ≠ "last updated."** Derive each page's `datePublished` from its first commit (clamp to ≤ `dateModified`) and omit it when unknown; use the content's refresh date only for `dateModified`. Feeding the "last updated" value into `datePublished` republishes old pages on every data refresh, misleading to Google and LLM consumers.
- **Sitemap `<lastmod>` is the real per-page change date, never today's stamp.** And a no-op QA/UAT or "zero regressions" commit is not a content update. Date-bump logic that feeds ordering, `lastmod`, or a displayed "updated" date must skip routine non-content commits and keep the last *meaningful* change date.
- **Ship structured data + a sitemap + `llms.txt`.** A JSON-LD block (`@type` Article / Report / Dataset) with `headline`, `description`, `datePublished`/`dateModified`, `author`, `about`; a `sitemap.xml`; a `robots` meta; and an `llms.txt` for agent consumers (generated from the data, kept in sync by a test). On a GitHub Pages *project* site (`user.github.io/repo/`), `robots.txt` at the subpath is not read by crawlers that only fetch the domain root — ship it anyway for direct-fetch tools and intent documentation, but don't rely on it; submit the sitemap manually and lean on meta + JSON-LD + canonical.

## 12. Common pitfalls (the "scar tissue" list)

These are encoded across this folder's projects. If you're tempted to undo them, read the rationale.

### 12.1 The `[hidden]` trap

`display: inline-flex | block | flex` on an element that uses the `hidden` HTML attribute silently overrides the implicit `display: none`. The element renders despite `hidden` being set.

**Always** ship a `[hidden] { display: none }` rule alongside any `display: ...` override. If the element animates out (e.g. slide), use `visibility: hidden` + `transform` on `[hidden]` instead.

### 12.2 `text-overflow: ellipsis` no-ops on `display: inline`

A `<span>` defaults to `display: inline`; `overflow: hidden` + `text-overflow: ellipsis` silently does nothing. Always set `display: block | inline-block | flex | grid` on the element you're ellipsizing. Pair with `min-width: 0` on the parent grid item.

### 12.3 IntersectionObserver callbacks need a scroll-position guard

`isIntersecting === true` is necessary but not sufficient for "user scrolled near the bottom." During tab swaps and in headless contexts, layout can settle in multiple paint passes, firing the observer several times. Each firing prefetches another page. Add an explicit `scrollHeight - scrollTop - clientHeight > 400` check to bail when the user hasn't actually scrolled.

### 12.4 Anything that enumerates a fixed list MUST iterate the source-of-truth array

Reset buttons, dropdown populators, persona buttons, anything that touches "all programs / themes / tiers / categories" must iterate from the canonical constant array, never a hardcoded subset. When the list grows, the iterating code picks up the change for free; the hardcoded subset silently drops the new entries.

### 12.5 No web fonts without sign-off (see § 2)

### 12.6 No CSS `filter` on hot paths (see § 10)

### 12.7 Pills do NOT fall back across columns

When a row has a "Program" column and a "Status" column, the Status cell must render Status-specific content (or `—`), never the Program pill as a fallback. Two identical pills doubles visual noise without adding signal.

### 12.8 The default-AI aesthetic (see § 1.1)

Violet/indigo gradient + centered hero + two buttons + same sans + emoji cards = the model default, and it reads as disposable. Anchor a real identity in the subject first (§ 1.1). Highest-priority visual rule here, not a nice-to-have.

### 12.9 Fetch from absolute paths, and check `response.ok`

Fetch data from absolute paths (`/data/x.json`), never relative (`../data/x.json`). Relative paths break silently when the page's directory depth changes. And `fetch(...).then(r => r.json())` swallows a 404/500 into a confusing parse failure: throw on `!response.ok` with the status, and render the actual `error.message` (not a generic "failed to load") so debugging isn't blind.

### 12.10 Cache-bust user-facing assets, and rule out stale cache first when debugging

A browser serving an old `app.js` is the most common silent frontend failure. The error you see is from code that no longer exists. Version JS/CSS (`?v=YYYYMMDD`) so deploys bust the cache, and when debugging a frontend bug, hard-refresh as step one before touching code.

### 12.11 Mobile collapse must be deterministic

Don't drive a responsive show/hide off the `hidden` attribute or a native `<details open>` default alone. Once restyled, their behavior is inconsistent across breakpoints. Drive open/closed from a `matchMedia` listener with an explicit `display: none` per breakpoint (collapsed on mobile, forced visible on desktop), so the state never rides on attribute quirks. (`<details>` is still the right primitive for *user-toggled* disclosure per § 7. This is about *breakpoint-driven* collapse.)

### 12.12 A `var()` alias resolved in `:root` doesn't inherit the dark-theme override

Aliasing a semantic token to a base token in `:root` only (`--tariff-accent: var(--stance-positive)`) does **not** pick up the `[data-theme="dark"]` override. The alias resolves once against `:root`, so descendants in dark mode keep the light value and badges/chips/icons render wrong. Define the token with **literal values in both** `:root` and `[data-theme="dark"]` (mirror the working `--stance-*` / `--status-*` families); don't alias across token families and expect the theme cascade to follow.

### 12.13 `#page=N` only jumps on a same-origin, inline-rendered PDF

A deep link to a PDF page (`href=".../order.pdf#page=60"`) lands on the page *only* when the browser renders the PDF inline from the same origin. A cross-origin PDF, or one behind Cloudflare or an attachment `Content-Disposition`, ignores the fragment (or downloads instead). To deep-link a page, commit/serve the PDF same-origin; keep the official external URL as a separate visible link. Regression-test that each link's target page actually contains its quoted text.

### 12.14 The 44 px touch target is for *touch* — don't bloat desktop

A `min-height: 44px` on a small inline control (a "show more" toggle, a tag chip) makes it tower next to lightweight elements on desktop and read as a primary CTA. The 44 px guideline is about coarse pointers. Style the control at its natural chip scale and restore the touch target only where it applies:

```css
@media (pointer: coarse) {
  .show-more-toggle { min-height: 44px; padding: 10px 12px; }
}
```

Same number, applied where it matters — desktop stays visually quiet, touch stays comfortable.

### 12.15 SVG rotation via the `transform` attribute conflicts with CSS `transform-origin`

Combining an SVG `transform="rotate(-90 cx cy)"` attribute with a CSS `transform-origin` (which defaults to `50% 50%` of the element's own bounding box, not the SVG attribute's pivot) composes both, rotating the element far off its intended center — a donut-chart's colored arcs can render fully off-canvas while an unrotated background ring masks the bug. Rotate via CSS only: `transform: rotate(-90deg); transform-box: fill-box`, and drop the attribute transform.

### 12.16 CSS-only hover/disclosure popouts need `:focus-visible`, not `focus-within`

`group-hover` + `focus-within` (or the plain-CSS equivalent) keeps a popout open after a mouse click, because a click leaves the trigger focused and `focus-within` doesn't distinguish that from a real keyboard-focus visit. Use `group-has-[:focus-visible]` (or `:focus-visible` scoped to the trigger) so a mouse click doesn't leave the panel stuck open with no way to close it short of JS.

### 12.17 A truncation/disambiguation helper must be collision-aware, not fixed for the one case you saw

Shortening a name or label to fit a column (e.g. dropping a suffix) can produce two different entities rendering identically once shortened (two people both truncating to the same surname). Fixing the first collision you notice isn't enough — the helper needs a collision list, or a second, distinguishing token, not just a per-record patch. And when the fix already exists on one render path (e.g. mobile), reuse it on every other path instead of re-implementing the same display logic twice.

### 12.18 `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(...))` produces a lopsided orphan row

When the last row has fewer items than columns, `auto-fit` collapses the empty tracks and stretches the partial row to fill the width (3-then-2 items rendering as ~50%/50% instead of ~33%/33%/33%). Force `repeat(N, 1fr)` instead when the item count is known ahead of render.

### 12.19 A percentage/delta formatter must collapse near-zero before applying a sign

Rounding a small negative value (e.g. `-0.004`) *after* formatting the sign renders `-0.0%`, a value nobody wrote and nobody wants to see. Collapse `|v| < threshold` to `0` before formatting the sign.

### 12.20 `content:` glyphs need unicode escapes, not raw UTF-8 characters

A static host serving CSS without an explicit `charset=utf-8` header can mojibake a raw arrow/caret character in `content: "▾"`. Use the unicode escape (`content: "\25BE"`) instead — ASCII, encoding-proof.

### 12.21 An iframe-embedded component reads its own viewport, not the host's

`window.innerWidth` inside an embedded iframe reports the iframe's own width, not the page that embeds it. For host-viewport-based breakpoints, read `window.parent.innerWidth` with a try/catch fallback for cross-origin embeds.

### 12.22 A cached/keyed component won't re-render on a changed expression unless its key also changes

A component mounted with a stable `key` (e.g. an iframe or a memoized panel) can keep its old instance even after the JS expression driving it changes, because the framework only remounts on a key change. Bump the key alongside any logic change that must actually take effect.

### 12.23 An undefined CSS custom property silently resolves to nothing, not an error

`var(--undefined-thing)` fails silent: no console error, no failed test, just a themed component rendering invisibly (e.g. white-on-white) on whichever theme happens not to define that token. Audit `var(--x)` references against actual definitions across every theme file; don't rely on visual QA under a single theme.

### 12.24 A map library needs real container dimensions before it can size itself

Calling `setView()`/`fitBounds()` before a flex/dynamic layout has settled computes against a zero-width or stale container, causing a world-zoom or a visible jump on load; hiding the map container via `visibility`/`opacity` compounds this, since the library needs real box-model dimensions to size itself. Create the map view-less, then call `invalidateSize()` and `fitBounds({ animate: false })` inside `requestAnimationFrame` once layout has actually painted.

### 12.25 In-page anchor links inside an SPA view-router collide with hash-based routing

A numbered "on this page" jump link or a cross-tab cross-reference can't use a real `href="#section"` if the app also treats hash changes as a view-router signal — the anchor click fires the router instead of scrolling. Wire jump targets through the existing click-delegated scroll wiring (a `data-scroll-to` attribute) instead of a hash href. Where an anchor handler *does* legitimately intercept clicks for cross-tab jumps, it still has to fall through on modifier/middle-click (so cmd/ctrl/middle-click still opens a new tab) and push the fragment to `history` so the deep link is shareable and the Back button returns to the origin — prefix-agnostic matching (any in-page anchor with a resolvable target, not a hardcoded list of known ids) means new card families get cross-tab linking for free.

### 12.26 Don't trust a layout measurement taken mid-reflow

A heading or element read via `getBoundingClientRect()`/`offsetHeight` immediately after a DOM mutation can report a transient in-flight value (e.g. 800px) before layout settles to its real size (29px) a paint or two later. Re-measure after layout has actually painted (next frame / a `ResizeObserver` callback), the same class of bug as §12.24's map-sizing trap but for text/heading measurement rather than a map container.

### 12.27 Color an aggregate stance/sentiment grid by net signed value, not by plurality or presence

A cell aggregating many individual support/oppose/mixed judgments should color by net sentiment (support − oppose over engaged count), not by whichever category has the most instances (plurality) and not by whether any signal exists at all (an all-neutral cell is "no position," not "contested"). Compute the band once and share it between the cell color and the legend so they can't drift, and only render a legend swatch for a band that actually occurs in the data — a legend key for a state with zero instances (e.g. "net oppose" when 0 of 60 cells qualify) misrepresents what's on the page.

### 12.28 One sorted list of incomparable rows lies by layout

A single list sorted by a number that means different things across rows (a search-traffic estimate vs. a "present in feed" flag) tells the eye they're on one scale; the low-scale source always sinks to the bottom and reads as least important. Group into labeled per-source lanes and rank within each; label the lane ("ranked within source"). A within-lane meter (§ 8.13) then compares only comparable things. The data-layer rule behind this lives in CLAUDE.md ("don't rank incomparable series on one scale").

### 12.29 Never display a number that contradicts one you also quote

When a source's own headline figure conflicts with the detail it aggregates (an infographic whose bar labels sum to a different total than its headline number), show the source's stated figure, or its stated share, cited, not a recomputed sum. A page must never contradict a value it puts on screen elsewhere. Log the source-side discrepancy so a later editor doesn't "correct" a faithful transcription; keep a document's own subtotal over a sum of its rows when the two disagree.

### 12.30 An `overflow-x: auto` chart silently eats its newest data

A time-series whose axis outgrows its container scrolls — and a scroll container starts at `scrollLeft: 0`, i.e. parked on the **oldest** end. The recent data (usually the whole point) is off-screen with no affordance, and it reads to the user as *"the data is missing"* — not as "scroll me." Three-part fix, and you want all three: (1) size so the axis **fits** at your real breakpoints (measure, don't assume); (2) keep the **scrollbar visible** (`scrollbar-width: thin` + a styled `::-webkit-scrollbar`) — a hidden scrollbar is *how* data disappears quietly; (3) after render, **park `scrollLeft` on the most recent** column, so whatever does clip is the empty past, never the live present. Widening the bars (a grouped/parallel variant) is the usual trigger — it doubles axis width in one edit.

### 12.31 `offsetLeft` lies about clipping — measure against the scroll container's rect

`offsetLeft` is relative to the nearest **positioned** ancestor, which your scroll container usually isn't. Compare it against `scrollLeft`/`clientWidth` and you get confident nonsense — a chart that fits fine reports its last column as "clipped." For "is this child visible inside that scroller," use `getBoundingClientRect()` on both and compare the rects. (Distinct from §12.26, which is about measuring *too early*; this one is measuring against the *wrong origin*.)

### 12.32 A chart rendered inside a `display:none` tab has zero `scrollWidth`

Anything that measures or sets scroll at render time is a **silent no-op** when the view is still hidden — so the fix from §12.30 quietly doesn't apply, and the bug reappears exactly where you thought you'd killed it. Do the work again after layout exists: a `requestAnimationFrame` pass, a `ResizeObserver`, or on tab activation. Idempotent, so call it both times.

### 12.33 A filtered chart keeps a shared scale — and prefer a filter to a second visual encoding

Rescaling a chart to its **filtered** subset is a lie: a level with one record renders a full-height bar, exactly as tall as the 58-record quarter next to it. Derive the axis range **and** the y-scale from the **unfiltered** dataset, so filtering reads as filtering *in place* — categories stay comparable and a sliver stays a sliver. Pin it with a test ("the near-empty category must not render full height"); it's the kind of thing that regresses silently. Relatedly: when a small chart needs a second dimension, reach for a **filter/toggle before a second visual encoding** — texture-as-category and grouped bars both make one chart carry two scales (and grouped bars trip §12.30). Colour = one thing. If you truly must encode a second dimension inside the marks, use texture — **never** a second colour ramp.

## 13. What's intentionally NOT in design

Decisions made by *omission*:

- **No icon libraries by default.** System glyphs + outline pills cover most needs. Add Lucide/Heroicons only at ~30+ distinct glyphs.
- **No animation libraries.** CSS transitions + `animate-pulse` suffice.
- **No marker clustering** when canvas markers + decimation handle the load (`leaflet.markercluster` only when grouping is a real interaction).
- **No multi-toast queue** until a project needs it.
- **No infinite zoom / unconstrained pan.** Set `maxBounds`. Most projects have a meaningful viewport.
- **No backend until profit/scale demands one.** Static-first: JSON in `docs/`, GitHub Pages. (levels.io: "you don't need a backend.")

---

## 14. When to revisit this document

- A new component pattern emerges across 2+ projects (promote from project `design.md` to here).
- A bullet in § 12 (pitfalls) repeats in a third project. That means it needs more emphasis or a different remedy.
- A new accessibility standard lands (WCAG update, platform-level mandate).
- A perf budget regresses across the portfolio (e.g. mid-range Android performance audit).

---

## Influences

- **FT, Bloomberg Businessweek, ProPublica, Greater Greater Washington**: editorial gravitas through typography and restraint, not dependencies.
- **Linear**: typography discipline, dark UI without losing readability.
- **Apple Human Interface Guidelines**: touch targets, safe areas, mobile-first ergonomics.
- **Pieter Levels (levels.io)**: "you don't need a backend, you don't need a CSS framework, you don't need a font, you don't need npm." When in doubt, ship the simpler thing.
- **Andrej Karpathy**: performance budgets are real constraints, not afterthoughts; measure before optimizing; the smallest version that works is the right starting point.
